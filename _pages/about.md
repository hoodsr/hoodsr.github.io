<p>I graduated from the University of South Carolina Honors College in May 2016 with 
a B.S. in Computer Science and minors in Math and German. I'm currently 
getting my Master's while working as a research assistant in the 
<a href="https://afrl.cse.sc.edu">Autonomous 
Field Robotics Lab (AFRL)</a> and as an Introduction to Java TA (CSCE 145). </p>

<p>I have previously interned at Boeing and worked as a web developer. My Master's thesis is on 
Unmanned Aerial and Unmanned Ground Vehicle cooperative exploration and mapping.</p>
