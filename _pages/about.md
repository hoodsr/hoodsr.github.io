I graduated from the University of South Carolina in May 2016 with 
a B.S. in Computer Science and minors in Math and German. I'm currently 
getting my Master's while working as a research assistant in the Autonomous 
Field Robotics Lab (AFRL) and as an Intro to Java TA. I have previously 
interned at Boeing and worked as a web developer. My Master's thesis is on 
Unmanned Aerial and Unmanned Ground Vehicle cooperative exploration and mapping.
