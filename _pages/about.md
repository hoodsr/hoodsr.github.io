I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the <a href="http://schc.sc.edu/">University of South Carolina Honors College</a> in May 2016 with 
a B.S. in Computer Science and minors in Math and German. I'm currently 
getting my Master's while working as a research assistant in the 
<a href="http://afrl.cse.sc.edu/afrl/home/">Autonomous 
Field Robotics Lab (AFRL)</a> under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://cse.sc.edu/~yiannisr/">Ioannis Rekleitis</a> and as an CSCE 145 Introduction to Java TA. 
My Master's thesis is on Unmanned Aerial and Unmanned Ground Vehicle cooperative exploration and mapping, and is a continuation of the Bird's Eye View project.</p>



<p>I have previously interned at Boeing as a Software Engineer where I developed the webSMT, which can be used to load software onto airplanes. I have also worked as a web developer for the Second Pillar consulting company.</p>
