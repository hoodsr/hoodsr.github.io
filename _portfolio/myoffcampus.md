<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>MyOffCampus allows students to rate and review landlords and properties. They can search for somewhere they are thinking about living, or search for somewhere they currently live to leave a review. If they are searching for an apartment or place to live, users can then sort the results by rating or alphabetically. The user can see the location of the property on google maps on the property’s page, or what properties are owned by a landlord on the landlord’s page. </p>
<p>Users can also save properties and landlords they are interested in for 
viewing later. If a person cannot find the property or landlord they are looking for, they can add the property or landlord and then leave a review for others to see. This app aims to give more information to students to enable them to make better and easier choices in the hunt for off campus living.
